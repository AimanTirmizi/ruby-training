## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A - No comments required. Perfectly executed

This could instead be written as ...

> Ensure proxy methods are also caught

### Pass Rate - 2

A - All pass

### White box analysis - 1.25

A - No flaws, code is as close to completed as possible. No improvements available

### Miscellaneous Criteria
