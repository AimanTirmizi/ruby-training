* Pass Rate - **15%**
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
  * Did you pass the `lcd_numbers_spec.rb` in its entirety?
  * Did you pass all tests?
* White box analysis - **45%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **5%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

I can clearly follow exactly what you were thinking, the evolution of your code and how it was progressing

There were a few minor mistakes, but nothing too serious

Make sure to focus again on describing the problem, and not describing the code

### Pass Rate

C

Passed both basic specs. Missed quite a bit of technical implementation details for the advanced specs

### White box analysis

C

Your code is still quite confusing to read, there are a lot of big methods

You made some concerted effort to chunk up into many small methods, then near the end you reconstituted
the methods back together into the big methods. Remember many small(er), methods are better!

Also remember to focus not only on static analysis through rubocop, but also flow analysis. Check unrequired
branching and any/all redundancies

### Miscellaneous Criteria

B

No real issues. Few language / wordy issues, but overall a good attempt

### Overall Grade

B

Very good attempt at a hard project. Just got to try ironing out the small kinks now but definitely a **lot**
of evolution in style and progress!
