* White box analysis - **50%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

There is some clear evolution, but some of the evolution didn't make sense (However I marked down elsewhere)

### Pass Rate

A

All passes no issues

### White box analysis

C

There is a little bit of linting that could be improved

There is a lot of confusing code that isn't quite what was expected. No arguments or blocks are permitted in
your methods

### Miscellaneous Criteria

B

Some of your commit messages don't quite marry up to what is observed

### Overall Grade

B

A very good attempt - To improve to an A, double check the define method signature on rubydoc
