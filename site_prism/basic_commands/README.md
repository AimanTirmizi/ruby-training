# Site Prism

This is a basic framework that allows you to create POM (Page Object Model objects), and then use
these objects to query web pages using a nice clean semantic DSL (Domain Specific Language).

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ gem install bundler # if you don't have it already
$ bundle
```

## Working through the exercise

To run the exercise, you just need to run:

```
$ ruby exercise_1.rb
```

## How this will work

Each time we write some new code, we need to try observe what the code is doing, and see if we can
learn a little whilst doing it. The exercises will be provided with the boilerplate code already
written, so there isn't much needed from the pupil.
