## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **30%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate - **40%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

You iterated on work. You made some tests pass, then fail (with bad code), then pass again. You improved on
your existing code with new code

### Pass Rate

A

All tests pass. Flawlessly written, no over-engineering

### White box analysis

C

Not only is there a lot of redundant code here, but your own styles seem to change

It does feel like you're definitely making improvements, but the errors here are both stylistic and functional
and as such I feel that you can only warrant a C

Remember to ask yourself with the O(N) vs O(N**2) problem, do I need the additional overhead...

### Overall Grade

B

You were only a fraction of a point off an A. But given all the mistakes made, next project is likely to be
a strong A, as you're making clear evolution and improving week on week!
