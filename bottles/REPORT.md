## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **30%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor in the correct places?
* Pass Rate - **25%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed all redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **15%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)
  * Incremental working through `skip`

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

You have done some good TDD. However I'm still a little concerned it's not quite organic

Make sure you're attempting to refactor early. This will help you with later problems that get more complex

### Pass Rat

A

No real issues

### White box analysis

B

Your code is quite neat and tidy, but it would break a lot of linting metrics

Your code is easy to understand and follow, but it would be hard to extend much more

You have removed some of the redundant code, but not all

### Miscellaneous Criteria

B

Your incremental work was good, the git commits are still a little flaky

Make sure we're describing our commits in terms of what has been done (In some you do this, others you
describe the code change)

### Overall Grade

A

Just scraped an A. I think you're definitely improving and taking on board the comments

Let's make sure as we move forward we're following all the good practices, there are some you're quite good
at and others you're a little less strong at. Focus on those ones for the next project
