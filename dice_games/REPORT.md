  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?

## Grades

### Following TDD principle

B

Greed - Good TDD approach - apart from the red-green-**refactor**
Dice - Average TDD approach - remember the purpose of commits (Not marked down due to double jeopardy)

### Pass Rate

A

Solid pass-rate

### White box analysis

C

Greed - not very good - Lots of linting improvements, quite complex logic, non-isolated private/public.
You also use quite a lot of un-ruby like constructs and high cyclomatic scoring logic
Dice - very good minor linting improvements

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

There is a mixture of good and bad commit logic and the solution to the extra test wasn't sufficient

### Overall Grade

B

Just scraped a B. A good attempt, but remember the evolution of your git work, try keep that consistent

Also remember the enumeration / ruby-like constructs that are there to help you, use those wherever possible!
